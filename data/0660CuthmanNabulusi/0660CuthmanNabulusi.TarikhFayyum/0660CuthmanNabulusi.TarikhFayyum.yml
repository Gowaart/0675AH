90#BOOK#COMMENT##: A survey of the Fayyūm, made by an Ayyūbid 
    administrator in the year 641. The original title of the treatise
    is Iẓhār ṣanʿaŧ al-ḥayy al-qayyūm fī tartīb bilād al-Fayyūm,
    but it is better known under the title "Tārīkh al-Fayyūm"
    since Bernhard Moritz edited it under this title.

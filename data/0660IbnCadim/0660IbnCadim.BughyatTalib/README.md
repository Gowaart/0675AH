## 1. Describe why you chose this specific version of the text. Why others, in your opinion, are worse?

I chose Shamela as there has all the 12 Volumes wheras JK is missing two. Also the structure seems better as there are alreadz a lot of tags there. 

## 2. Which edition you used for collation? How close the text to the edition? Is pagination the same?

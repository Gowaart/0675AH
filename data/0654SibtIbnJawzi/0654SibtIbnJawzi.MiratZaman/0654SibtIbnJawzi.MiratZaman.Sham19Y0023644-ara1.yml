    0654SibtIbnJawzi.MiratZaman.Sham19Y23644.

    NOTE OF THE ANNOTATOR (HRH): All the obituaries are tagged manually. A few ones
    might be missing. In some cases, there are biographies inside an obituary. 2-
    The subtitles are sometimes not exclusive and contain the rest of the text that
    is not relevant to them. I tried to separate some of them by adding blank
    headers. But, this needs reading the text closely. 3- Missing pages:
    PageV20P100-200.
